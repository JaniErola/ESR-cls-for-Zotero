# CSL-file, European Sociological Review -reference format

At some point a year ago I was submitting a manuscript to European Sociogical Review. However, I was not able to locate a suitable csl-file to use with Zotero, so I made one. As some of the colleagues were now asking for the style file, I decided to make it public. If I recall right, it is based on the Harvard style file already available on Zotero. 

This is still much work in progress. When installing, Zotero complaints it is not a valid style file and it still requires some hand editing to get the reference list right. So any contributions are welcome!
